# FF1AutoTracker
Auto tracking application for Final Fantasy 1

This application consists of two parts, a Lua script for FCEUX and an exe file which displays the current game status.

To track your game's progress first run the executable and then load the ff1_tracker.lua script in FCEUX.  The tracker window
will automatically update object status when events happen in the game.

For example, here is a comparison of when the game starts versus a nearly completed game.
