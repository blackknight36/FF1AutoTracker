# FF1AutoTracker
Auto tracking application for Final Fantasy 1

This application consists of two parts, a Lua script for FCEUX and an exe file which displays the current game status.

To track your game's progress first run the executable and then load the ff1_tracker.lua script in FCEUX.  Load the screen using the File, New Lua Script Window option.

Then click "run".  The tracker will automatically update object status when events happen in the game.

For example, here is a comparison of when the game starts versus a nearly completed game.
